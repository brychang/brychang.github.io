Carp is a generic name for a group of freshwater fish.

Imagine a single carp. The carp emerges from its egg, roughly at the same time as thousands of siblings. It begins to swim and eat. It responds to the locations of other carp around it. When the other carp turn, it turns in the same direction. This leads to schooling behavior.

Asian carp consist of several species, some of which have been introduced into fish ponds in the US to clear algae. Some carp have escaped from these ponds, leading to invasion of US freshwater systems. We hope to control the invasive species.

Could we use the carps' schooling behavior against them?
